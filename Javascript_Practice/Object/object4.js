constructors do not have a return statement. Their task is to write all necessary stuff into this, and it automatically becomes the result.

But if there is a return statement, then the rule is simple:

If return is called with an object, then the object is returned instead of this.
If return is called with a primitive, itâ€™s ignored.


function BigUser() {

  this.name = "John";

  return { name: "Godzilla" };  // <-- returns this object
}

alert( new BigUser().name );  // Godzilla, got that object

/*

let user = new User; // <-- no parentheses
// same as
let user = new User();
