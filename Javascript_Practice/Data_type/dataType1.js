//STRING


/*

Strings canâ€™t be changed in JavaScript. It is impossible to change a character.


let guestList = `Guests:
 * John
 * Pete
 * Mary
`;

console.log(guestList);


let guestList = "Guests: // Error: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
  * John";

single or double quotes do not work this way.
Single and double quotes come from ancient times of language creation, when the need for multiline strings was not taken into account. Backticks appeared much later and thus are more versatile.
